Hello, i'm François LEBEUX from Rennes, Brittany, FRANCE. I'm Front End Engineer at iAdvize and i work on different personal project.

One of my passions is to discover and drink some craft beer or wine with my friend.

I'm a member of CRAB (Collectif Rennais des Amateurs et Amatrices de bières), an association of home brewers that share their passion with talent.

From my work and this passion was born this project.

Enjoy.
